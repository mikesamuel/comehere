    <h1>Rebooting printf debugging<br><small>Towards scanf debugging</small></h1>

    <p>
      Printf debugging is no substitute for robust, automated test suites, but
      it is a critical practice in exploring, understanding, and debugging code.
      JavaScript introduced the <code>debugger</code> keyword almost thirty years
      ago to aid in debugging.
      But the language has only added one feature since then to
      explicitly aid debugging: <code>console</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are proud to announce a JavaScript language proposal to make it easier
      to printf debug large JavaScript projects.
      This is the culmination of research by many brilliant people at (TODO: fake organization).
    </p>

    <p>
      Below, you can see the proposal in action!
      Imagine you're debugging a piece of code.
      You suspect that some inputs to a <i>deeply nested helper function</i> will
      help you understand what's going on.
      But getting the right inputs to that function requires reverse
      engineering a <i>program input</i> that would cause the desired function call.
      That's now unnecessary. Simply tell the program to <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> with
      the inputs you want, and it will.
    </p>

    <table id="editor-table">
      <tr id="scroll-back-button-row" style="display:none">
        <td width="50%" colspan="2" align="center">
          <button id="scroll-back-button">Go back to article &#x2935;</button>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><div id="editor"></div>
          <button id="play-button" type="button"
                  title="Run the code in the editor on the left">‚ñ∂Ô∏è</button>
          <select id="block-choice"></select>
          <p>
            <big>‚¨ë</big> That play button runs the code.  The selector lets
            you pick which <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> block to run.
          </p>
          <div id="console-output"></div></td>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><div id="translation"></div></td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <script type="module" src="./editor-support.mjs"></script>

    <p>
      On the left you can see a sample program that uses <big><code>COMEHERE:with</code></big>
      to cause a function to be called with certain inputs.
      And then it logs those outputs.
      It's <i>printf debugging on steroids</i>!
    </p>

    <p>
      Hit the <i>play</i> button below the editor to see the console
      output from the <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> block body.
      Below are the parts of a <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> block:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>There's a syntactic marker.  This is placeholder syntax
        that let's us integrate the proposal into existing toolchains.
      <li>If there's a quoted string right after the open parenthesis,
        it's a <i>description</i>.  It's optional but providing it helps
        tools like the developer console make it easy to pick the
        right block when interactively debugging a module.
      <li>Then there are zero or more <i>assignments</i>. This lets the
        developer control the values of inputs to functions and
        class instances that contain the target
        <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> block.
      <li>Finally, there's a <i>body</i>, statements to run that help
        the developer understand their code.</li>
    </ul>

    <p id="annotated-syntax-example"><br>
    <code><span class="part-marker" id="part-marking-syntax"><span>Syntactic marker</span>COMEHERE:with</span> (<span class="part-marker" id="part-desc"><span>Optional description</span>"Lorem Ipsum"</span>, <span class="part-marker" id="part-assigns"><span>Desired bindings</span>x = 1, y = 2</span>) {

      <br>}</code>
    </p>

    <p>
      <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> works by
      &ldquo;driving control&rdquo; to the block.
      Look at the top line of the translation on the right above;
      when <code>seeking_0</code> is <code>1</code>, it'll call
      the containing function, and within it, will log some
      information about intermediate values.
    </p>

    <p>
      With <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big>, loading the module
      has the side-effect of letting the user
      (via <code>debugHooks</code>) choose what to debug and
      logging valuable information.  No need to reverse engineer
      program state to explore what's going wrong.
      But when <code>seeking_0</code> is 0, it has no semantic
      effect on the code.
    </p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Driving control&rdquo; means making branching choices
      that end up running the chosen <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big>
      blocks.  In the below you can see two blocks.  <small>(Hit the
      'üìã' button to play with the example code in the editor
      above.)</small>  If <code>seeking_0</code> is 1 then it ignores
      the result of <code>Math.random()</code> and jumps into
      the <i>then</i> branch regardless; if it's 2 it jumps into
      the <i>else</i> branch regardless; otherwise it runs as if there
      were no <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> blocks at all.
    </p>

    <p>
      Similar code translation tricks drive control into other constructs &hellip;
    </p>

    <p>Loops bodies:</p>

    <include src=".html-includes/side-by-side/loop.html"></include>

    <p>Switch cases:</p>

    <include src=".html-includes/side-by-side/switch.html"></include>

    <p>Catch blocks inside try statements:</p>

    <include src=".html-includes/side-by-side/catch.html"></include>

    <p>Members in classes:</p>

    <include src=".html-includes/side-by-side/class-method.html"></include>

    <p>
      Short-circuiting expressions, expressions that blur the
      distinction between expressions and control flow.
    </p>

    <include src=".html-includes/side-by-side/short-circuits.html"></include>

    <p>
      Below is a tricky example. A recursive function that recurses
      <i>before</i> reaching the <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> block.
      If the translation wasn't careful, <code>n</code> would be 2 when
      it was first reached instead of 10 as requested.
    </p>

    <include src=".html-includes/side-by-side/fibonacci.html"></include>

    <p>
      Another thing to note is that, when one or more
      <big><code>COMEHERE</code></big> blocks occur right after a
      <code>return</code> statement, they can run and the special
      expression <code>Function.return</code> refers to the returned
      value. (That syntax only works inside those blocks)
    </p>

    <p>
      We asked more than twenty veteran printf-debuggers, &ldquo;if you could
      make one change to printf to make it even more obviously the
      best way to debug programs, what would it be?&rdquo;
      Unanimously, they wanted to print a value alongside the code
      that produced it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any variable that starts with two dollar-signs
      (<code>$$0</code>, <code>$$foo</code>, etc.), and which is
      not defined in the containing module is treated specially:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>We create a definition in the deepest function or module
        body that contains all references to that variable.
      <li>When the variable is assigned, we store information
        about the code that derived the new value.
      <li>When the variable is used in a spread (<code>...$$0</code>),
        the code precedes the value.
    </ul>

    <p>
      That enables wrapping a complex intermediate expression
      in <code>($$0 = complexIntermediate())</code> followed by
      <code>console.log(...$$0)</code>.
    </p>

    <include src=".html-includes/side-by-side/dollarDollar.html"></include>

    <p>
      And if the $$name variable is assigned along multiple paths,
      that code reflects the last affecting intermediate expression.
    </p>

    <include src=".html-includes/side-by-side/abs.html"></include>

    <p>
      But wait, there's more! If we can super-charge <i>printf
      debugging</i>, what about other format string functions?
      We pored over both <i>"stdio.h"</i> and
      <i>&laquo;stdio.h&raquo;</i>, and we're super proud to
      announce that COMEHERE enables an entirely new debugging
      paradigm: <i>scanf debugging</i>.

      Below, the arguments for the function come from interactive
      browser functions.

      TODO: decorator that recurses before call corner-case discussion.
      Decorators, unlike function proxies, intercept simple calls by name.
      A decorator that wraps a function in a way that recurses with different
      arguments before invoking with the arguments would observe activeFns
      in an unintentional state.

      There are solutions to this problem but they involve work beyond
      the scope of this demo: desugaring function hoisting and
      decorator application.
